    "In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, natural language processing, and financial time series.<br>\n",

    "The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN. The layer's parameters consist of a set of learnable filters (or kernels), which have a small receptive field, but extend through the full depth of the input volume. During the forward pass, each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input volume, computing the dot product between the entries of the filter and the input and producing a 2-dimensional activation map of that filter. As a result, the network learns filters that activate when it detects some specific type of feature at some spatial position in the input.<br>\n",

Similarly, for any integer $S > 0 $, a stride of S causes the filter to be translated by S units at a time per output. In practice, stride lengths of $S \\geq 3$ are rare.

However, it's not always completely necessary to use all of the neurons of the previous layer. For example, a neural network designer may decide to use just a portion of padding."
